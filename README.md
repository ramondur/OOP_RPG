# OOP_RPG

This program was developed for the class of Object Oriented Programming at KU Leuven. The main goal of this was to train basic OOP concepts such as Dynamic Binding, Polymorphism, Restricted and Unrestriced Associations in different ways (Defensive, Nominal and Total Programming). In the program itself we have 3 major classes that define monsters, items (weapons, backpacks and purses) and weights. In the main file we have to monsters fighting eachother and the winner taking possession of the looser's items if possible. All classes are accompanied by a test file of most of all methods.
